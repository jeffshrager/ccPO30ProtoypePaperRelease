<h3>A Tour of the Cancer Commons Knowledge Platform</h3>

<p>

The audiences for -- i.e., users of -- these tools are different sorts
of people. TrEx is intended to be used by physicians, whereas Quark is
intended to be used by someone that we call a "Clinical Analyst", who
may or may not be a physician. There is also a third UI that sits
between these, and requires a little of each skill. You'll be
pretending to be different sorts of users -- to wear different hats --
as we progress through the tour. I'll tell you when to change hats!

<p>

First a few words of warning to give you the right perspective:

<p>

First: The interfaces that you will see on this tour are pretty
rough, and look a little better on a tablet than on a laptop or
desktop browser. Don't focus on how things look; Focus instead on
the <em>functionality</em>. Also, although the databases and examples
used in this tour are real (they generally come from peer-reviewed,
published papers), they are often out-of-date, so you shouldn't take
anything that you see here as valid medical advice.

<p>

Second: This tour covers several applications which together comprise the
<em>Cancer Commons Knowledge Platform</em>. These applications are
technically separate, but there are pathways along which they interact
to form specific workflows. Although this tour follows a particular
such workflow. There are many alternative workflows that you can
explore at your leisure.

<p>

Okay, so with those caveats in mind, let's begin:

<p>

<h3>TrEx -- The Treatment Explorer</h3>

<p>

The principal function of TrEx, the Treatment Explorer, is to rank
possible therapies based upon test results and peer-reviewed evidence.
TrEx is a direct implementation of the algorithm described in this
paper:

<p>

<a target=_blank
href=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0011965>Mocellin,
S., Shrager, J. et al. (2010) Targeted Therapy Database (TTD): a
model to match patient's molecular profile with current knowledge on
cancer biology. PLoS ONE, 5(8):
e11965. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0011965.</a>

<p>

and the TrEx prototype here uses the database published in that paper,
with some minor simplifications. Since that paper was published in
2010, this database is <em>extremely</em> out of date. Nevertheless,
you'll get the idea.

<p>

Let's begin by putting on our oncologist (physician) hat, and opening
the TrEx prototype application, here:

<p>

<a target=_blank
href=http://platformtest.cancercommons.org:4240/trexui>TrEx -- The
Treatment Explorer</a>

<p>

You'll see some instructions, and then a table of tests, with
"Positive", "Negative", and "Untested" buttons to the right of
each. Let's focus on the first test in the list: "BRAF mut V600E". To
begin with, click "Positive" to the immediate right of that test, and
then click the button just above the table, labeled "Rank Drugs". 

<p>

You should get a new table above the test table, containing two
treatment options: PLX4032 (now called Vemurafenib), and the
combination treatment melphalan + actinomycin-d. Now Find the BRAF
V600E test again (which should be marked "positive", as you had left
it), and change the setting to "negative". Again rank the treatments
and notice that the order of the two treatments is reversed, which
makes sense.

<p>

Play around with this a bit by setting some of the test results in
random ways and notice how the treatment rankings change. The ranking
algorithm is described in detail in the Mocellin et al, 2010 paper,
linked above.

<p>

Now notice that all of the tests and treatments are clickable
links. Return to the PLX4032 treatment (in the top, treatment table),
and click that link. You should see three rows of evidence appear in a
new browser tab. These are the three sources of evidence that
participate in the ranking of this treatment.

<p>

Return to the main TrEx page and find the BRAF V600E mutation test
line. Click on the "BRAF mut V600E" link. This should again bring up
an evidence table (in a new tab), this time with many rows. These are
the rows of evidence related to this clinical observation (that is,
the observation of a BRAF V600E mutation). Notice that many possible
drugs besides PLX4032 appear in this table? Why are only two of them
ranked when this aberration is observed? The reason is that only the
PLX4032 and melphalan + actinomycin-d entries have (a) clinical
evidence (i.e., most of the evidence is in vitro, which is not counted
as strong enough to be included in this implementation of TrEx), or
(b) the relationship was experimentally null (i.e., it reads: "no
relationship with" in the "relation to" column). To see this, look for
"Sorafenib" in the "Drug" column. Notice that every row that relates
to Sorafenib is either non-clinical-level data (in the "model"
column), or, where there <em>is</em> clinical evidence, it says "no
relationship with" in the "relation to" column.

<p>

Notice that the "source" and "notes" column entries in this evidence
table are also clickable. Try to click any of them and you'll see that
they link through (in most cases) to the PubMed entry for the paper
from which the evidence was obtained. This enables you to examine the
source of the evidence if you like.

<p>

<h3>Quark -- The Case and Insight Capture Tool</h3>

<p>

We call each of the rows of evidence that we saw again, in TrEx, a
<em>"Treatment Rationale"</em> (TR). Mocellin et al. manually created
a table of TRs for melanoma, which they called the "Targeted Therapy
Database". But they left open the problem of how to ensure that the
database of TRs was continually updated. This is the role of the
second application on this tour: Quark. 

<p>

In this paper:<p>

<a target=_blank
href=http://shrager.org/vita/pubs/2013PervasiveHealth15.pdf>J
Stevovic, et al. (2013) Adding Individual Patient Case Data to The
Melanoma Targeted Therapy Advisor. Presented at the 7th International
Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare. May,
2013, Venice, Italy.</a><br>

<p>

The authors describe an extension to TrEx (previously referred to as
the "Targeted Therapy Advisor") that would collect individual,
case-based information from patients and/or their physicians, and
which augmented the TrEx database with this data. Quark is a prototype
implementation of this envisioned extension. We conceive Quark as the
biomedical analog of a <a target=_blank
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype>court-reporter's
steno-type machine</a>. A specially-trained professional, that we call
a "Clinical Analyst", would use Quark to capture the important parts
of the discussion regarding treatment choices, in a setting such as a
tumor board. The most important parts of this discussion are, of
course, the Treatment Rationales (TRs). TRs captured in this manner
are expressed by the Clinical Analyst in Controlled Biomedical English
(CBE), a version of a <a target=_blank
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_natural_language>Controlled
Natural Language (CNL)</a>. The TRs, thus captured in CBE/CNL are then
vetted (a sort of lightweight peer reviewe). Those TRs that pass
vetting are immediately added to the TrEx database, and will have
immediate impact on the drug ranking results as computed by TrEx.

<p>

Before going to Quark and demonstrating this process, return for a
moment the main TrEx window, scroll all the way to the bottom, and
click the button labeled "Reset DB". This will remove left-over TRs
from your, or others', previous experiments. (Yes, this will mess up
anyone else who happens to be using these prototype application at the
same time as you, but we aren't too worried about this. In real usage,
this button would not exist, and you would also be logging into the
system as a registered user, with permission controls, and so on. For
the moment, we don't expect enough users to be trying this at the same
time for them to run into one another. And if they do ... oh
well.... :-)

<p>

Now, finally, before leaving TrEx (don't worry; we'll be back soon!),
scroll up to the place where "EGFR" tests would appear if there were
any (the table is alphabetical), and notice that there are no EGFR
tests. (The TTD used here was created for melanoma, and in 2010 there
was no clinical evidence relating EGFR to melanoma.)

<p>

Okay, now scroll to the top of the test table, and click the link
labeled: "[Add insights via Quark]" (in the navigation bar at either
the top or bottom of the page), and while it's changing pages, quickly
switch into your Clinical Analyst hat!

<p>

This is the Quark Analyst's Dashboard, prefilled with some example
notes from a (made up, of course!) tumor board meeting. I suggest
entering something recognizable into at least one of the fields at the
top of the page. This will enable you to identify that the transcript
is yours if you were to see it again. (If you use the email field,
don't put your real email address in because, as mentioned before,
other users who might be testing the prototype are sharing the same
database!)

<p>

Now let's examine the (made up, of course!) tumor board
transcript. First, notice the header labeled "[Cheatsheet]". If you
hover over this link (at either the top or bottom of the transcript) a
large "tool tip" will appear, reminding you -- now playing the role of
Clinical Analyst for this tumor board -- about the way that Quark
expects to see certain special entries. The only rule that we care
about for the moment is where "insights" are prefixed by asterisks
(*). (A TR is a kind of insight. There are other kinds of insights,
but we'll use these terms interchangably here.)  Note that there are
several lines in the transcript prefixed with stars. These are TRs
represented in the fairly general, yet controlled, language that we
called, above CBE or CNL: "Controlled Biomedical English" or, more
generally, "Controlled Natural Language". (Hereafter we'll just called
it CBE). Notice that there are various ways to state treatment
rationales in CBE.

<p>

Let's prereview what's going to happen next, before actually trying
it.

<p>

We're going to push some of the TRs in this (made up, of course!)
tumor board transcript into TrEx, and see that they will have an
impact on the way that TrEx ranks treatments. The TRs that we're
pushing through in this way are written in CBE. When we tell Quark
that we're done with this transcript, the Quark system will translate
TRs (indicated by stars in the first column) into the internal
representation used by TrEx. It then submits these to the lightweight
peer review process called "vetting". In order for the TRs to actually
get added to the TrEx database, two reviewers have to agree with
them. Once TRs are vetted and added to the TrEx database, they
participate in the TrEx drug ranking process.

<p>

Let's see this in action!

<p>

Notice the line in the transcript that says:

<p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>*In a randomized controlled trial with 200 patients with stage 2
metastatic melanoma (Shrager & Tenenbaum, 2014), EGFR expression leads
to resistance to cisplatin. </i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Don't change anything in the transcript. Just scroll to the bottom and
click the red button labeled "Save and Close". When you click this you
will be prompted to make sure that you want to terminate the
transcript session. Click "Yes" (or "Ok").

<p>

<h3>The Vetting Tool</h3>

<p>

When you do the above, you will end be put into the Evidence Vetting
tool. As mentioned above, you now need to be wearing both your 
Clinical Analyst and your Oncologist (physician) hats.

<p>

There are lots of buttons and things to click on in the vetting
tool. Find the entry containing the TR above:

<p>

<ul>
<p><i>In a randomized controlled trial with 200 patients with stage 2
metastatic melanoma (Shrager & Tenenbaum, 2014), EGFR expression leads
to resistance to cisplatin. </i></p>
</ul>

<p>

Our job now, as a peer reviewer, is to assess this assertion along the
dimensions indicated by the four 3-way scales below the assertion:
Agreement, Generality, Evidence, and Importance. None of these do
anything that matters on this tour except the leftmost scale:
Agreement.

<p>

Suppose that we actually don't know whether we agree with this
assertion or not because we don't know enough about it, or the context
in which it was collected. There are links in the vetting tool that
can help us understand the assertion better.

<p>

Start by clicking on the assertion itself. This will bring up a tab
containing a read-only display of the quark transcript that we had
just submitted. (If you filled in some of the fields, such as the
email address, you should be able to tell that this is the one you
actually saved.) This can be useful in understanding the context in
which this assertion was made.

<p>

Now go back to the vetting page, and notice that there is a button
labeled "Search on Google Scholar". When you click it the whole text
of the TR is entered into google scholar and searched.

<p>

These tools should help you figure out whether you believe the
assertion or not. Let's say that we decide that we do believe the
assertion. We'll select "Agree", and then scroll to the bottom of the
page and click "Submit". This will take us back to TrEx!

<p>

Unfortunately, it's a bit premature to celebrate, because you actually
need TWO reviewers to agree with the assertion in order to get it
accepted and added to the TrEx database. We're just going to fake it
by clicking the link on the TrEx paged labeled "[Vet knowledge]" (in
the navigation bar). 

<p>

This will bring you back to the vetting page; click "agree" again on
our favorite TR, and then "Submit" again. This time we'll be in TrEx
with that TR (hopefully) added to the database!  (If you were to click
on "[Vet knowledge]" again, you'd find that the TR we're interested in
no longer appears in the vetting interface; It's already been
accepted, and requires no more vetting!)

<p>

<h3>Closing the Loop: Back to TrEx</h3>

<p>

Okay, so now we should be in a new world where TrEx knows about EGFR
expression and its relationship to cisplatin. Let's check that out by
finding the row in the test table that should now be there, but recall
that it wasn't before, called "EGFR expression". If you click on the
test, it will bring up the usual evidence table. However, now you'll
see evidences rows that came from the vetted TRs that were translated
from the BCE in the (made up, obviously!) tumor board transcript back
in Quark! Recall that when the evidence came from papers, you could
click through to the publication entry in PubMed. With evidence that
came through Quark, these functions work similarly to the Vetting
tool: You can click through to either the Quark transcript context, or
to a Google Scholar Search. Try it!

<p>

Finally, let's get back to TrEx and try out our new knowledge! Let's
click "Positive" next to our new "EGFR expression" test, and then Rank
Drugs. If all went well, you should get Cisplatin as a recommended
treatment! <em>Voila!</em>

<p>

<h3><em>Insights in Oncology</em> -- A NanoJournal </h3>

<p>

One more cool little thing to visit before the tour ends: All the
insights in the TrEx database, including ones that you just added (and
those that will eventually be added by someone who actually knows what
they're talking about! ;-) are published in an archival "nanojournal"
that we call "Insights in Oncology". (This is a working title; I'm
pretty sure that's already taken!)

<p>

From the TrEx mail window, find the link called "[Visit the
'<em>Insights in Oncology</em>' nanojournal]" (in the navigation
bar). This will take you to the nanojournal, which is really just a
long list of all the treatment rationales in the system. There isn't
much you can do here at the moment, other than scan forward and
backward in this list, and click through to the papers on PubMed or
the case contexts, just as we did before when we were looking at TrEx
records from the TrEx UI. Eventually we'll have lots more
functionality in the journal, such as search and commenting.

<p>


(There's one more little feature, that will only be interesting to
geeks: Notice that each record (row) has a leftmost ID column. If you
click on the ID in a row you'll be treated to the very hard to read
internal representation of that record. You may wonder why you would
be interested in this. Well, <em>you</em> might not be interested (or
even wonder why you would be interested...), but this sort of "API"
(google it!) is extremely useful to programmers who want to write
applications that uses the TrEx database!)

<p>

<h3>The End</h3>

<p>

And that's the end of our tour! Thanks for your attention. (Tips, as
well as questions or comments, can be sent to "jeff@cancercommons.org"
